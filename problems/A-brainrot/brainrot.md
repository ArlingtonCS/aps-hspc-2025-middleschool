# Brainrot

Everyone knows about the brainrot terms of this generation. Words like Skibidi
and sigma leave older generations confused. To fix this, you are to write a
program that outputs the second part of a brainrot phrase when given the first
word.

If the word is skibidi, print toilet. If the word is fanum print tax. If the
word is sigma output male.

# Input

# Output

For each phrase, output the corresponding word on a new line


# Sample Input
```
