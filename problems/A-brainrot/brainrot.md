# Brainrot

You may know about the "brainrot" terms of this generation. Words like "skibidi" and "sigma" leave older generations confused! Your task is to write a program that outputs the **second part of the brainrot phrase when given the first word.**

Your program should do the following:
- If given the word `skibidi`, print `toilet`.
- If given the word `fanum`, print `tax`.
- If given the word `sigma`, print `male`.

The input to your program will only be one of these three words (`skibidi`, `fanum`, or `sigma`)

# Input
The first line of the input is the number of words. The next lines each contain a word.

# Output

For each word, output the corresponding second word on a new line


# Sample Input
