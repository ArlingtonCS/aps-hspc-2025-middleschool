# Soccer Passes

You are a soccer player on a team practicing precise passes. The coach has drawn a soccer field as a coordinate plane, where:

 - The center of the field is (0, 0).
 - Each player stands at a specific coordinate point.

Your job is to calculate the distance between two players after a pass.

# Input

The input consists of two lines:

1. The coordinates of Player A, ($x_1$, $y_1$).

2. The coordinates of Player B, ($x_2$, $y_2$).

# Output

Print the distance between Player A and Player B, rounded to two decimal places.

# Sample Input

3 4  
7 1  

# Sample Output

5.00

# Explanation

The distance between (3,4) and (7,1) is:

$\sqrt{(7-3)^2+(1-4)^2}$ = $\sqrt{16+9}$ = $\sqrt{25}$ = $5.00$
